	#autoLOC_KRON0051 = The sheen of the ice crystals sparkling below is mesmerizing.
	#autoLOC_KRON0052 = You look down at Scool from your spaceship.  The lack of craters would normally suggest a young age, but the appearance of the surface suggests a slow dessication over eons.
	#autoLOC_KRON0053 = Crew reporting in, safe on the surface of Scool's Icebowls.  The crew wishes to thank the Kerbal Knitters Assoc. for the blankets.  They have came in handy.

	#autoLOC_KRON0076 = The term "Dusty Snowball" has taken a relativistic turn, as Scool appears to be quite literally dust, and ice.
	#autoLOC_KRON0077 = Ice, and dusty dunes, you ponder the plight of Scool as a dessicated snowball.
	#autoLOC_KRON0078 = The dust adheres to everything down here!  It has an oily-gritty consistency once it smears onto or into anything.
	#autoLOC_KRON0079 = Your acrophobia is balanced with awe as you float high above Eahpeh.
	#autoLOC_KRON0080 = You take note of the vast monotone ice sheet below.

	#autoLOC_KRON0122 = Sparks of electricity arcs are spectacularly emitted from the instrument after activation.
	#autoLOC_KRON0123 = Running tests here VOIDs all warranties, but you decide to run them anyway, because you are not at home.
	#autoLOC_KRON0124 = The sample tests are ran through in an extremely nominal manner.  Whats next on the agenda?
	#autoLOC_KRON0125 = The samples seem to react in a rather sluggish way.
	#autoLOC_KRON0126 = The materials act it a nominal way, mostly.
	#autoLOC_KRON0127 = The water sample is frozen solid. Other samples samples react to the frigid conditions in various ways.

	#autoLOC_KRON0145 = The atmosphere is a bit thin up here on the Peaks of Kersex.

	#autoLOC_KRON0147 = Readings confirm that there is no atmosphere on Meelo.
	#autoLOC_KRON0148 = You think you saw the instrument read something other than zero.  Mission control informs you that they might be transient gases.

	#autoLOC_KRON0159 = You can tell from the readout that lower gravitational fields match up pretty well to the high peaks on Scool.
	#autoLOC_KRON0160 = Scans provide interesting results pertaining to the interior of Scool.
	#autoLOC_KRON0161 = Scans indicate that the interior of the moon is a slightly liquid, slightly frozen mush.
	#autoLOC_KRON0162 = Scans indicate rolling gravitational waves associated with tidal flows from the moon's interior.
	#autoLOC_KRON0163 = The sensor detects a few minor quakes. Kersex does appear to have active plate tectonics.
	#autoLOC_KRON0164 = Scans indicate a radiating fracture pattern in the crust that permeates the crust of Kersex in this region.
	#autoLOC_KRON0165 = The sensor detects a few impacts on the surface of Meelo, helping scientists get a better picture of what the interior of the moon is made up of.

	#autoLOC_KRON0169 = You scanner is torn asunder by the intense motion of supercritical gases.
	#autoLOC_KRON0170 = Some of the gases have gone super-critical under intense pressure and shorted out the electronics on your scanner.
	#autoLOC_KRON0171 = The high atmosphere of Kronkus is composed mostly of hydrogen, nitrogen, and helium, with a trace amounts of various other compounds.
	#autoLOC_KRON0172 = The atmosphere at this altitude is a bit rarefied.
	#autoLOC_KRON0173 = You detect high humidity over the water.
	#autoLOC_KRON0174 = You detect low humidity over the Deserts of Kersex.
	#autoLOC_KRON0175 = You detect mostly nitrogen, and oxygen.  Very similar to Kerbin with only minor differences.
	#autoLOC_KRON0176 = You detect a layer of fluorocarbons in the atmosphere at this altitude.  They must act as a blanket holding in heat keeping the planet from becoming an iceball.
	#autoLOC_KRON0177 = Kronkus is a humongous, violet hued, ball of swirling gases.  The actual number of rings around Kronkus has become a favorite point of conjecture among Kerbal Astronomers.  Some estimates of the number of rings range as high as 200, other Kerbal scientists take a more conservative, and pragmatic approach, arguing that the actual number of rings didn't matter, it was more about the aesthetics, and emphasized lens cleanliness awareness.
	#autoLOC_KRON0178 = Eahpeh was the last of the Kronkian moons to be discovered.  This tiny shepherd moon's existence was overlooked for quite a while by the bewildered scientists, dazzled by wonders nearby.  Eahpeh was finally confirmed as an actual moon of Kronkus after a disgruntled poster salesman wrote the Kerbal Space Agency complaining about a so called 'stray dot' totally ruining the aesthetics of his most popular poster.  The print is still his best seller.
	#autoLOC_KRON0179 = Kersex was kept secret for many years after it's discovery in order to keep it an exclusive vacation destination.  Someone blabbed.
	#autoLOC_KRON0180 = Meelo is a large monotone moon orbiting Kronkus.  This sensible moon was voted home to "The most stunning views in the Kronkus system" three years running!  Scandal erupted shortly after it was discovered that the voting had been tampered with.
	#autoLOC_KRON0181 = Scool is the furthest out Kronkian moon, and is usually referred to as "The dusty snowball moon of Kronkus" for obvious reasons.  Some hold out hope that it will be recognized as the most wonderful skiing destination in all of the Kerbol system, others argue that that notion might be a little far fetched due to it's lack of atmosphere.  It's lack of atmosphere, however, allows periodic, unobstructed, spectacular views of the seemingly choreographed dance of the Kronkian moons.
